## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to evoke a sense of calm and intellect, suitable for an educational tool. This is not teal. Also, this contrasts against a dark background, and it is quite versatile, suiting a range of interfaces.
- Background color: Dark navy (#1A237E) to provide a professional and focused atmosphere. Use just enough saturation (around 20%) to keep it from feeling like plain old black. Keep the brightness very low, suitable for a dark color scheme.
- Accent color: Violet (#7E57C2), an analogous color, for interactive elements to make them pop without disrupting the harmony.
- Clean and modern typography
- Use clear, minimalist icons
- Subtle transitions to enhance the user experience
